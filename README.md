About
------
I got tired of tracking my lifting progress with Evernote. Manual input is tedious. I found that the most polished tracker on the market is [the Stronglifts App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.stronglifts.app&hl=en). However, I wanted an app that's tailored fit for the [Starting Strength program](http://startingstrength.com/). Also, Stronglifts hides features like plate breakdowns and warmup weight calculators behind microtransactions. I figured I could build as polished an app, while learning Angular and Ionic, and not hide nifty features behind a paywall.

I hope this app is as useful to you as it is for me. It's a labor of love, and I won't ever charge for it. Starting Strength 3x5 uses the [General Public License](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html), meaning you're free to modify/improve it as you wish.
